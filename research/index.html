        <details><summary>[Abstract]</summary>Based on data from the China Health and Nutrition Survey and Surface Water Quality Weekly Report, we estimate the effects of water pollution, tap water, and their interaction on individual health status. Using the panel IV regression method, we find that water pollution significantly increases the morbidity rate, while ignoring the different levels of pollution exposure caused by the use of tap water may lead to a serious underestimate of the impact of water pollution. Regression results show that tap water can offset about 60% of the negative health effects of water pollution, and the non-offsetting part may come from pollutants that cannot be eliminated by treatment processes in waterworks. Finally, comparing the disease cost and the total health cost caused by water pollution, we find that nearly 2/3 of the health cost can be attributed to the disease cost. As one of the most important infrastructure investments, the adoption of tap water greatly eliminates the negative impact of water pollution on the health of Chinese residents. This has important general implications for low-income countries with a low proportion of tap water supply worldwide.</details>

        <details><summary>[Abstract]</summary>This paper examines how extreme temperatures shape firm entry decisions and industrial geography. Leveraging comprehensive firm registration data from China, we identify an inverted U-shaped relationship between temperature and firm entry, while firm exit remains largely unresponsive. Sector analyses reveal that temperature extremes suppress firm entry in agriculture and industry through production shocks, and in services through demand-side spillovers. Firms also adapt by shifting equity investments toward new firm establishments in regions with milder climates. Climate projections indicate that ongoing warming will significantly reshape industrial geography, with warmer regions experiencing greater losses. These findings highlight firm location choice as a critical channel of climate adaptation and underscore the role of temperature risk in driving long-term spatial economic change.</details>

        <details><summary>[Abstract]</summary>Extreme temperatures threaten agriculture and exacerbate global food insecurity, yet their direct impact on dietary choices remains poorly understood. We provide the first evidence of how short-term exposures to hot or cold weather may affect macronutrient intake in China. We find that hot weather reduces carbohydrate and protein consumption but not fat intake, while cold weather increases all nutrient intakes, particularly fats. Both conditions elevate high-fat diet risks. Fans, air conditioners, and heating systems mainly mitigate these effects by altering thermal comfort, whereas refrigerators, which primarily serve to store food, show minimal impact. These results suggest that temperatures may influence dietary patterns more through physiological appetite regulation than food accessibility. Socioeconomic disparities are evident, with rural and less-educated individuals more likely to adopt high-fat diets. Projections indicate that climate change will generally increase high-fat diet probabilities, with northern regions experiencing declines and southern regions rising due to differing temperature changes.</details>

        <details><summary>[Abstract]</summary>Climate change presents critical environmental challenges including water quality management. Surface water quality in China, measured using different indicators, has improved over the years. However, seasonality patterns across key water quality indicators are contradictory. While dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration reaches its worst levels in late summer, other major indicators, such as permanganate index (CODMn) and ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N), show opposite trends. Through regression analysis, this study reveals a strong negative relationship between DO concentration and air temperature, explaining the seasonal contradictions observed across key water quality indicators. Higher air temperatures lead to an increase in water temperature, thereby reducing the DO concentration in water. Since this temperature–DO concentration relationship is primarily a physical rather than a chemical process, current water quality assessments in China may be biased, particularly under warmer conditions, potentially overestimating water pollution severity and influencing environmental policy decisions. Similar challenges with water‑quality management also exist globally. Therefore, we recommend selecting metrics that match each specific water‑use purpose. Drinking water standards should rely on DO saturation, whereas DO concentration should be retained for criteria that protect aquatic biodiversity. Our findings emphasize the interplay between climate change and water quality management, providing critical insights to achieve Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and advance integrated environmental management strategies.</details>
